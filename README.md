# DA-Font: Few-Shot Font Generation via Dual-Attention Hybrid Integration (ACM MM 2025)

## Abstract

Few-shot font generation aims to create new fonts with a limited number of glyph references. It can be used to significantly reduce the labor cost of manual font design. However, due to the variety and complexity of font styles, the results generated by existing methods often suffer from visible defects, such as stroke errors, artifacts and blurriness. To address these issues, we propose DA-Font, a novel framework which integrates a Dual-Attention Hybrid Module (DAHM). Specifically, we introduce two synergistic attention blocks: the component attention block that leverages component information from content images to guide the style transfer process, and the relation attention block that further refines spatial relationships through interacting the content feature with both original and stylized component-wise representations. These two blocks collaborate to preserve accurate character shapes and stylistic textures. Moreover, we also design a corner consistency loss and an elastic mesh feature loss to better improve geometric alignment. Extensive experiments show that our DA-Font outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across diverse font styles and characters, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing structural integrity and local fidelity.
